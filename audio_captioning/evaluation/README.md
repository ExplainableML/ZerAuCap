## Evaluation

In this folder, we store tools to analyze the results. You find two Jupyter Notebooks in the folder ``audio_captioning/evaluation/development_result_jsons`` that contain the code that we have used create the validation plot (Figure 2) and the model ablation plot (Figure 3). The image files are stored in the folder ``audio_captioning/evaluation/plots``.
